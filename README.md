# Tiramisu Web Application Framework
#### A web application framework inspired by CakePHP 2.

---

Because of the restrictions working within corporate environments, I have a need for a web application framework which is java based.
In previous applications, I have used CakePHP for rapid web application development.
I really like some of the design choices which the CakePHP project has used, so I have attempted to build a simple Java based web application which is similar to Cake.

**This is still a work in progress**

Don't forget to add the static directory serving, otherwise the web application won't serve static content.
