# Tiramisu Web Application Framework

---

This is a web application framework written entirely in Java, using common libraries available to Java projects.
The framework supports Regex URL patterns, a [Hibernate Database](http://docs.jboss.org/hibernate/orm/5.2/javadocs/org/hibernate/dialect/package-summary.html), velocity templates and everything in between. The framework is built around the MVC methodology.

Current plan is to implement user authentication, authorization coming at a later date.

**This is still a work in progress**
